## To Do: 
### 22/07/2021
- [x] Research and choose a framework -> _It was difficult choosing between React and Vue, but I'm going for Vue since it would be nice to have a functioning app in every popular framework. After making a Todo list with React, a review website with Angular it would be nice to build something with Vue._

- [x] Research about using Vue components -> _I made a presentation about the basics of Vue a while ago, but I hadn't really used components, so I need to look up on how to implement them in a project._

- [x] Set up the framework files -> _Using the CLI command, so we get all the project folders in place._

- [x] Recycle files used in previous presentation -> I took the small example from my presentation and made them into separate components and made the function work inside a component setup
