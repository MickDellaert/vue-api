## To Do: 
### 22/07/2021
- [x] Research and choose a framework -> _It was difficult choosing between React and Vue, but I'm going for Vue since it would be nice to have a functioning app in every popular framework. After making a Todo list with React, a review website with Angular it would be nice to build something with Vue._

- [x] Research about using Vue components -> _I made a presentation about the basics of Vue a while ago, but I hadn't really used components, so I need to look up on how to implement them in a project._

- [x] Set up the framework files -> _Using the CLI command, so we get all the project folders in place._

- [x] Recycle files used in previous presentation -> _I took the small example from my presentation and made them into separate components and made the function work inside a component setup._

###l 23/07/2021
- [x] Make the results from the users search display in a card style grid -> _Not using Bootstrap this time, trying to make the website responsive using flexbox and media queries._ 
  
- [x] Try to get a modal pop up when a meal is selected to show more details -> _Look into making a modal work in Vue, passing methods and variables between components._

- [x] Implement a message popping up when no results are found -> _Add conditional statements to the fetch async function._

- [x] Further styling

- [ ] Find a way to display the ingredients with a loop
